# Bezier.js

An ES Module based library for Node.js and browsers for doing (quadratic and cubic) Bezier curve work.

For a Demo and the API, hit up either [pomax.github.io/bezierjs](http://pomax.github.io/bezierjs)
or read the souce (`./lib` for the library code, start at `bezier.js`).

**Note:** if you're looking for the legacy ES5 version of this library, you will have to install v2.6.1 or below. However, be aware that the ES5 version will not have any fixes/updates backported.

## Installation

`npm install bezier-js` will add bezier.js to your dependencies, remember to add `--save` or `--save-dev` if you need that to be persistent of course.

### Without using a package manager

There is a rolled-up version of `bezier.js` in the `dist` directory. Just download that.

## In Node, as dependency

About as simple as it gets:

```
import { Bezier } from "bezier-js";

const b = new Bezier(...);
```

## In Node or the browser, from file

Copy the contents of the `lib` directory to wherever you like (`/js`, `/vendor`, etc), or place the rolled-up version of the library there, and then load the library as an import to whatever script needs to use the `Bezier` constructor using:

```
import { Bezier } from "/js/vendor/bezier.js";

const b = new Bezier(...);
```

## Working on the code

All the code is in the `lib` directory, with `bezier.js` as entry point.

To test code (which automatically applies code formatting and rollup), use `npm test`.

There is no explicit build step for the library, `npm test` takes care of everything, except checking for code coverage.
